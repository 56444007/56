# Installation

# How Does It Work?
Maxun lets you create custom robots which emulate user actions and extract data. A robot can perform any of the actions: <b>Capture List, Capture Text or Capture Screenshot. Once a robot is created, it will keep extracting data for you without manual intervention</b>

### 1. Robot Actions
1. Capture List: Useful to extract structured and bulk items from the website. Example: Scrape products from Amazon etc.
2. Capture Text: Useful to extract individual text content from the website.
3. Capture Screenshot: Get fullpage or visible section screenshots of the website.

### 2. BYOP
BYOP (Bring Your Own Proxy) lets you connect external proxies to bypass anti-bot protection. Currently, the proxies are per user. Soon you'll be able to configure proxy per robot.

We offer a managed cloud version to run Maxun without having to manage the infrastructure and extract data at scale. Maxun cloud also deals with anti-bot detection, huge proxy network with automatic proxy rotation, and CAPTCHA solving. If this interests you, [join the cloud waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbD2uhqC4sbg4eLZ9qrFbyrfkXZ2XsI6dQ0USRCQNZNn5pzg/viewform) as we launch soon.
